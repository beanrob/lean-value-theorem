## Need To Do

- Formalisation & Proof of "constant functions are continuous"
- Formalisation & Proof of "fun x => x is continuous"
- Proof of "continuous functions are bounded"
- Proof of "sequential continuity implies epsilon delta continuity"
- Proof of "epsilon delta continuity implies sequential continuity"
- Custom Linarith Stuff "Saumya" wants to dabble in
- Implementing Saumya's traversible sequences stuff?

## In Progress
