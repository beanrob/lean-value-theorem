\section{Formalisation Details}

Our group intends to formalise the Mean Value Theorem:

\bigskip

\begin{center}
Let $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous, and differentiable on $(a, b)$.
\newline Then $\exists \, c \in (a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b
- a}$.
\end{center}

\subsection{Assumptions from MathLib}

As a starting point, we will import the following from MathLib:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ASSUMPTION
    \item ASSUMPTION
    \item ASSUMPTION
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formalisation Route}

The main necessary step to proving the Mean Value Theorem is proving Rolle's
Theorem. The MVT should follow naturally from proving Rolle's Theorem and should
require very little additional work after it is implemented.

Beyond this, we intend to prove the MVT by ...

\subsection{Compared to the MathLib Version}

Compared to the version in MathLib, our formalisation intends to make the steps
up to proving the MVT more intuitive and closer to how they would actually be
written.

\section{Project Management}

We will distribute the work amongst team members by ...

All work will be shared remotely via Git to a remote repository on GitHub to
ensure all members of the group have up-to-date code. Additionally, GitHub's
built-in features such as Issues and Projects will be used to manage what needs
to be done and prioritise the implementation of certain things.
